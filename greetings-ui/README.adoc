== Conception

Naive first ideas for UI

* 2 main modules
** Message
** Stats
* Message Type component (drop down list) should receive types from backend.
* Stats module is lazy loaded.
* There is a "button" (it could be an actual button or a checkbox) on Message window to open the stat component.
* In the Stat module there is a service which has a connection with an SSE endpoint on Stat-Service which can send it stat modifications events.
* Stats component doesn't receive new stats numbers from the SSE event and must use the "normal" endpoint to retrieve actual data.
